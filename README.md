FarmStack is a reference implementation of an open and interoperable data sharing protocol in agriculture sector. 



FarmStack enables network of data providers and consumers through a suite of products and functionalities:

1. Share data directly without any third party through trusted **peer to peer \(p2p\) connector**.
2. Empower the data provider to restrict usage of data through **usage policies**.
3. Give control of data back to the farmers by managing consent using **data wallet**.
4. Enable entities to create plugins to make their **data discoverable \(description of data\)**.

FarmStack is the sum total of all the peer to peer connectors and associated usage policies.
