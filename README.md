FarmStack is a reference implementation of an open and interoperable data sharing protocol in agriculture sector.

Farmstack is required because:

* Relevant farmer profile including farmer activity not available
* Lack of trust on misuse or under utilisation of data with a centralised data warehouse
* Need to comply with evolving data policy and privacy safeguarding measures
* Existing data integration tools lack the customisation

## Quick start

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalgreenorg/farmstack-open/UI_backend_integration/install.sh > fs-install.sh && bash fs-install.sh
```

In browser, open: [https://localhost:8000/](https://localhost:8000/) and follow the instructions

For more details see [local deployment](docs/deploying-farmstack/local-deployment.md).

## Features

FarmStack enables network of data providers and consumers through a suite of products and functionalities:

1. Share data directly without any third party through trusted **peer to peer \(p2p\) connector**.
2. Empower the data provider to restrict usage of data through **usage policies**.
3. Give control of data back to the farmers by managing consent using **data wallet**.
4. Enable entities to create plugins to make their **data discoverable \(description of data\)**.

FarmStack is the sum total of all the peer to peer connectors and associated usage policies.
